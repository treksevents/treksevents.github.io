## Distribution
Throughout the lowlands of Brunei, but nowhere very common. Widespread in Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, S. Thailand, Philippines and Sulawesi, the forms in the last two areas distinct.

## Uses
Produces a good quality cane for furniture manufacture; however it does not command the highest prices because the cane is rather uneven in cross-section. Fruits are used to make a sambal.
