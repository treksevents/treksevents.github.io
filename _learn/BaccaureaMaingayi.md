Leaves: petiole 31-120 mm long, glabrous to densely hairy, brown to black when dry, raised glands absent; stipules elliptic to ovate, 3-7.5 by 1.5-2.8 mm, velutinous outside, glabrous to rarely sparsely hairy inside, margin ciliate, not hyaline; lamina elliptic to ovate, 8-19.5 by 3.8-10.2 cm, l/w ratio 1.6-2.9, papery; base rounded to cordate to attenuate; apex cuspidate, 0-17 mm long; upper surface glabrous, raised glands normally present, often granulate, green to brown when dry; lower surface densely hairy, raised glands, normally present, absent, discoid glands absent to present, brown to green-brown when dry; secondary veins 8-11 per side, closed at margin; nervation scalariform; young leaves black when dry. Staminate inflorescences axillary to just below the leaves (to ramiflorous), solitary to 3 clustered together, 0.7-5 cm long, c. 1 mm thick, densely hairy to velutinous, 14-many-flowered, flowers clustered at the tip of inflorescence rarely somewhat scattered; branchlets cylindrical, 1.5-3 mm long, densely hairy to velutinous, 2-flowered; bracts absent. Staminate flowers 1-1.3 mm diam.; pedicel 0-1 mm long; sepals 4, ovate or variable in shape, 0.5-0.9 by 0.3-0.8 mm, straight, velutinous outside and inside; stamens 4, 0.2-0.5 mm long, glabrous; filaments 0.1-0.4 mm long, geniculate to straight; anthers c. 0.1 by 0.2 by 0.1 mm; pistillode absent. Pistillate inflorescences ramiflorous, solitary, c. 8.5 cm long, c. 1 mm thick, densely hairy to velutinous, 9-20-flowered; pedicel 3-3.5 mm long, upper part c. 0.5 mm long, geniculate (90¡ã bent), densely hairy; bracts 3 per branchlet, densely hairy outside and inside, margin ciliate. Pistillate flowers 2-3 mm diam.; sepals 6, ovate, 1.8-3 by 0.9-1.4 mm, velutinous outside and inside, persistent; ovary globose, c. 1.3 by 1.3 mm, 3-locular, velutinous; style absent; stigmas small, persistent. Infructescences 6-19(-45) cm long, 1-3 mm thick. Fruits globose, 0-2-seeded, fleshy capsules, 10-20 by 14-22 by 13-20 mm, often loculicidally dehiscent, raised glands sometimes present, velutinous outside, densely hairy to velutinous inside, green to orange; pericarp c. 1 mm thick; column 9-15 mm long, curved to straight, caducous to persistent; pedicel 7.5-13 mm long, upper part 2.5-5 mm long. Seeds ellipsoid, laterally flattened, 8-16 by 7-14 by 2-4 mm; arillode amber; cotyledons 6.5-7.2 by 6-7 by smaller than 0.1 mm. [from Blumea Suppl. 12: 1--216 (2000)]
