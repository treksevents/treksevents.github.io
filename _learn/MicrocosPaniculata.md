Shiral, (Microcos paniculata), (Chinese: 布渣葉)[2] is a flowering shrub native to China and south-east Asia.[3] It is sometimes added to Chinese herbal tea,[4] having a mildly sour taste. In traditional Chinese medicine the plant is believed to help the digestive system, and it is also used for other health problems including colds, hepatitis, diarrhea, heat stroke, and dyspepsia. [2] None of these alleged claims have shown to be effective in clinical trials. The herb may have a placebo effect.
