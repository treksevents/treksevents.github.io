Daemonorops is a genus of rattan palms in the family Arecaceae found primarily in the tropics and subtropics of southeastern Asia with a few species extending into southern China and the Himalayas.

The stems of the Daemonorops are harvest for their cores, which is used for everything from canes to furniture. The fruits of certain species, in particular Daemonorops draco, produce a red resin known as "Dragon's blood". The seeds of species such as Daemonorops margaritae (Chinese: 星月菩提) are harvested for the production of Buddhist prayer beads.
