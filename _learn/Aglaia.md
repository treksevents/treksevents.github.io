Aglaia is a genus of more than 390 species belonging to the Mahogany family (Meliaceae).

These trees occur in the tropical and subtropical forests of Southeast Asia, Northern Australia and the Pacific.

Some are important timber trees; others have edible fruits (such as duku and langsat), scented flowers, or medicinal properties. Many have complex biological relationships with their dispersal agents. Some show insecticidal bioactivity.
