## Diagnostics
Mid-canopy tree up to 35(-40) m tall and 69(-80) cm dbh. Stipules absent. Leaves alternate, compound, leaflets penni-veined, almost glabrous to densely hairy, sometimes whitish below. Flowers ca. 5 mm diameter, white-yellowish-red, placed in panicles. Fruits ca. 33 mm long, green-red, soft spiny drupes. Seeds with aril.

## Description
Tree, up to 40 m high, dbh up to 80 cm, sometimes with small buttresses, rarely a shrub. Twigs 2.5-15 mm in diam., tomentellous, tomentose, or velvety, mostly only late glabrescent. Leaves (1-) 2-9(-13)-jugate; petiole 2.5-21 cm long, 1-6 mm thick, terete to semiterete, in the latter case sometimes above with a longitudinal groove; axes mostly long remaining hairy; petiolules 2-7.5(-15) mm long, above variably grooved or somefimes flat, with or without a median rib. Leaflets (narrowly) elliptic, 6-35 by 1.8-12.5 cm, index 1.5-5, coriaceous or chartaceous, above glabrous to variably hairy along the midrib and on the lower nerves, rarely all over the surface, beneath variably hairy all over, between the nerves often minutely sericeous; domatia absent; base acute to broadly rounded, exceptionally subcordate, mostly variably attenuate; sides curved to straight and parallel; apex rounded to acute, mostly acuminate, the acumen up to 2.5 cm long, slender to sometimes broad, acute to sometimes obtuse; midrib above sunken to prominulous, nerves 0.5-2 cm apart, above prominulous to slightly grooved, intercalated veins variably developed, veins and veinlets either together closely or sometimes laxly reticulate, or the former +/- clearly scalariform, at least the veinlets beneath often hardly visible. Inflorescences most ly in the upper leaf axils, together pseudoterminal, sometimes terminal, also rami- or cauliflorous, often long pendulous racemes or spikes. Sepals hardly to up to halfway connate, 1.1-2.5 mm long. Petals mostly absent, if present often reduced in number. Disc hairy or glabrous. Stamens (4-)7 or 8 (or 9). Ovary 2-celled. Fruits ellipsoid to sometimes globular, 2-4 by 2-3 cm, glabrous or sometimes slightly hairy at the tip of the appendages, mostly densely set with appendages, those filiform to narrowly strap-shaped and up to 2 cm long, or sometimes ligulate and 5-6 mm long, straight or often curved or curled, at base globular, pyramidal, or triangular and in the latter case often connate; wall coriaceous, thin.

## Ecology
In undisturbed to slightly disturbed (open sites) mixed dipterocarp forests up to 800 m altitude. Along rivers and streams and on hillsides with sandy to clay soils, but also on limestone.

## Uses
The wood is locally used for construction work. The trees are often cultivated in forest gardens for their edible fruits.

## Distribution
