Scolopendra subpinipes (Scolopendridae) is a common centipede in the whole Asian subtropics and tropical area and is also introduced in many other countries and areas around the world.

It has many common names including Chinese Red Head, Giant Centipede, Jungle Centipede, Orange Legged Centipede, Red Headed Centipede and Vietnamese Centipede.

To date, Scolopendra subspinipes comprises six valid subspecies. Of these, Scolopendra subspinipes dehaani (shown in the photo), the largest subspecies (over 22 cm body length), has been raised to species level, Scolopendra dehaani (Kronm√ºller, 2012), because it is clearly separable from all other taxa of the Scolopendra subspinipes group by the absence of ventral spines at the prefemur of the terminal legs.
