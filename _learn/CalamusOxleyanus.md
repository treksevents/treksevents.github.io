# {{page.title}}

Calamus oxleyanus appears to have a wide range with separate subpopulations. At present it does not meet the criteria for a threatened category, however, across its range the lowland forest habitat in which it occurs is being cleared rapidly. The extent to which the species may be in decline from this threat is difficult to determine. Primarily due to the wide range from Thailand to Sarawak and Sabah, and its occurrence in numerous protected areas a rating of Least Concern is given here.
