Schizostachyum is a tall or shrub-like tropical genus of bamboo.[2][3] They are natives mostly of tropical Asia and Papuasia, with a few species in Madagascar and on certain islands in the Pacific.[1][4] A few have become naturalized in other tropical regions.[5]

The genus name comes from Greek schistos ("cleft") and stachys ("spike"), referring to the spacing of spikelets.

These are clumping, and sometimes climbing bamboos.
