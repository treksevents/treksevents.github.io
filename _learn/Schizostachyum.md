# {{page.title}}

Schizostachyum is a tall or shrub-like tropical genus of bamboo. They are natives mostly of tropical Asia and Papuasia, with a few species in Madagascar and on certain islands in the Pacific. A few have become naturalized in other tropical regions.

The genus name comes from Greek schistos ("cleft") and stachys ("spike"), referring to the spacing of spikelets.

These are clumping, and sometimes climbing bamboos.
