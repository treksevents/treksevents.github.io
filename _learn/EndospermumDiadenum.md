Endospermum diadenum is a mid-canopy tree with a diffused, dome-shaped crown; it can grow up to 36 metres tall. The stout, cylindrical bole can be unbranched for up to 25 metres and 60 - 150cm in diameter; it is sometimes thickly buttressed, the buttresses being up to 2 metres tall. The tree is a commercial source of the timber 'sesendok', and is commonly harvested from the wild both for local use and for trade.
