    <h2>Bio-diversity Conservation Projects</h2>
    <p>Our main conservation project presently is saving the amazing pitcher plants.</p>
    <p>Pitcher plants are rescued from roadsides, hill slopes and all land earmarked for development. All plants rescued will be rehabilitated and kept at English Garden, Theme Park Hotel for the current period. Some are displayed at TREKS outlet at Awana for public viewing.</p>
    <p>TREKS Nepenthes Conservatory practices 3Rs – Rescue of affected pitcher plants, Rehabilitate the plants indoor and outdoor and Replant them in strategic habitats that are less likely to be disturbed.</p>

    <h2>Treks Nepenthes Conservation &amp; display wall at English Garden</h2>
    <p>The Nep Wall (as we call it) is made up of a balau wood wall specially designed to display live rescued pitcher plants that have been rehabilitated for public viewing. The Nep Wall was installed in January 2016 and opened for public viewing on 8th February 2016 ie. the first day of Chinese New Year 2016.</p>
    <p>The present display of live specimens of mature pitcher plants is based on their natural growth habitat. The pitcher plant display panel on the left shows specimens that grow on slopes. The central display panel shows specimens that grow uprightly while the panel on the right shows specimens that grow horizontally.</p>
    <p>The present display also showcases other plants that are also part of the overall conservation study effort. They include the Fern Moss, Tree Fern and the Wild bamboo Orchids.</p>
    <p>It is planned that the display of live specimens will be changeable ie. a new display of live specimens will be installed every 2-3 months whilst the previous specimens will be sent to a holding area to be rehabilitated and recycled at a later date.</p>

    <h2>The Magnificent Pitcher Plants of Genting Highlands</h2>
    <p>Genting Highlands is endemic to 3 species of pitcher plants – N. macfarlanei, N. ramispina and N.sanguinea. Due to intense cross-pollination between the 3 species, an amazing number of hybrids evolved with amazing shapes, sizes, colors and forms.</p>
    <p>The amazing shapes, sizes, colors and forms are what makes the pitcher plants of Genting Highlands worthy of higher recognition.</p>

    <h2>Parallel Conservation Efforts</h2>
    <p>The other conservation specimens that are all part of the pitcher plant habitat are the Fern Moss, Giant Tree Ferns and the Wild Bamboo Orchids. These together with the pitcher plants are found in abundance in disturbed and abandoned land.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that these specimens of the Montane-Ericaceous Forest thrives in cold and high humidity conditions that is natural to Genting Highlands. Most of them do not thrive in warmer conditions.</p>
