    <h2>Fashion Forest (FF)</h2>
    <p>This is the lead project. The FF is a stretch of Upper Dipterocarp rainforest located on a ridge at RWGenting  Awana with a trail length of 500m and 500m width on both sides of the ridge. In it, our first effort is to study its rich bio-diversity, animals and plants kingdom, in depth.</p>
    <p>What have we initiated here?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We "fashioned a forest"
        <ol>
          <li>We created 5 Fashion Forest Galleries
            <ol>
              <li>Gallery 1 – Steps</li>
              <li>Gallery 2 – Forest Floor 1</li>
              <li>Gallery 3 – Forest Floor 2</li>
              <li>Gallery 4 – Forest Floor 3</li>
              <li>Gallery 5 – Fashion Forest Walk Trail</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Celebri-Tree Project – Making Supermodels of Our Animal and Plant Bio-Diversity</li>
      <li>Plant a Tree in Someone’s Heart – A Social Media Campaign to create a love for Nature </li>
      <li>Start Your Own Forest – A TREKS outreach bio-diversity initiative to get the Public, Special Interest Groups and Private Enterprise to start their own Fashion Forest akin to our Fashion Forest at RW Genting Awana</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To sum up, where Fashion Forest is concerned, TREKS creates, publicizes, manages and sustain an integral  part of a 130 million years old rainforest for eco-tourism and for bio-diversity interactive activities that benefits society at large.</p>

    <h2>Chocolate Forest (CF)</h2>
    <p>This is our second initiative. The CF is all areas within RW Genting  Resorts and fringes of the Montane-Ericaceous rainforest. </p>
    <p>What do we do here?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The key initiative is the setting up of a Nepenthes Conservatory. The efforts undertaken are:
        <ol>
          <li>Nepenthes Rescue &amp; Collection</li>
          <li>Nepenthes Rehabilitation</li>
          <li>Nepenthes Nurseries</li>
          <li>Nepenthes Display</li>
          <li>Nepenthes Trails</li>
          <li>Nepenthes Preservation</li>
          <li>Nepenthes Education</li>
          <li>Nepenthes Interactive Services</li>
          <li>Nepenthes Events</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Other parallel conservation efforts are:
        <ol>
          <li>Fern Moss Conservation</li>
          <li>Tree Fern Conservation</li>
          <li>Wild Bamboo orchids Conservations</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Animal  Kingdom studies</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In particular, TREKS aims to make the endemic Nepenthes of Genting Highlands world-famous for its hybrids, colors, shapes and sizes. </p>

    <h2>Sky Forest</h2>
    <p>Nature is not only about animals and plant life or only about the environment. It is also about nature ‘up above, in the air, in the sky and in the heavens’. One cannot say one has full grasp of nature without knowing what’s high above the forest floor.</p>
    <p>What we do:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Talk about the types of clouds and their splendor</li>
      <li>Talk about the Genting weather – the rain, the wind, the lightning and the thunder</li>
      <li>Talk about the altitude</li>
      <li>Talk about temperature</li>
      <li>Talk about the panoramic views</li>
      <li>Talk about the stars and the constellations</li>
      <li>Talk about the planets</li>
      <li>Talk about the moon and the sun</li>
      <li>Talk about the environment</li>
      <li>And talk about the animal and plant bio-diversity of the Montane-Oak rainforest</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="hr1"></div>

    <p>All said, at TREKS, we just want to bring subjects that are least talked-about for your awareness.</p>
    <p>What else is there about TREKS?</p>
